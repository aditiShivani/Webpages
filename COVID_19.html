            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.
             <br><br>• Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you—or they—do not have any symptoms.
              <br><br>• It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus.<br>
              <br>• Most people who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus have respiratory symptoms. They start to feel a little bit unwell, they will have a fever, they may have a cough or a sore throat or sneeze. In some individuals, they may have gastrointestinal symptoms. Others may lose the sense of smell or the sense of taste. Especially in the youngest children, they tend to be more mild, which means they don't have as many symptoms as adults do. Some children may have gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhoea or vomiting, but they tend to be more mild.            </p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed">Importance of using face mask<br>
                    A) The virus can be transmitted to other people if they come in contact with the infectious droplets or inhale the aerosols. Therefore, wearing face masks can be effective to prevent the spread.<br>
                    B) Using face masks prevents the sick people from spewing the respiratory droplets from their noses and mouths as they capture the large infectious droplets within the mask. They can also reduce the small droplets from being dispersed into the air to a certain degree.<br>
                    C) Face mask  create a barrier against droplets, a disposable face mask acts as a protective shield for a healthy person and prevents direct contact with the viral droplets. It doesn’t let the infections enter the oral and nasal space helping in keeping the person safe.<br></p>

                    The  Government of India has selected the priority groups who will be vaccinated on priority as they are at higher risk. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive COVID-19 vaccine will be persons over 60 years of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions.<br>
                    A2) Importance of vaccination
                    • The vaccine will help us achieve two things — one, it will further bring down the mortality, and secondly, it will bring down the number of cases.<br>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">According to experts at the John Hopkins Medicine, human behaviour is the major factor for the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The strict lockdown that was imposed last year slowed down Covid-19 pandemic in India giving the authorities time to ramp of requisite infrastructure but it forced people to be cooped up in their homes for long.<br>
                  Covid-19 protocol too came in along with the pandemic. Wearing a face mask, washing hands regularly and maintaining social-physical distance was advised and those who did not follow were penalised in some cases.<BR>
                   Many people actually ended up spending about one year inside their homes, practically locked.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">India has recorded over 1.2 crore cases of Covid-19 yet the pandemic is still mostly concentrated around cities, especially the bigger cities. These cities have greater mobility giving more opportunities for the virus to spread from one person to another when the guard is lowered.<br>
                  This is why cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Bengaluru, and Delhi are worst-affected in the second wave. However, they were also badly impacted in the first wave. The respective state governments have, therefore, imposed restrictions on travel from and to these cities in order to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 infections.</p>
